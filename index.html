          What is Flash Usdt
      </h4>
      <p>
        Flash Usdt is a utility-based coin created to act as a temporary replacement for tether(USDT)
        high-risk trades.it helps reduce exposure to real USDT while maintaining smooth transaction flow.
      </p>                                            
      <p>
        By using Fash Usdt in place of regular Tether, traders can reduce risk and manage volatility
        more efficiently during sensitive operations.
